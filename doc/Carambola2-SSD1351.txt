Quick howto for Carambola 2 + SSD1351
-------------------------------------

This is a very quick howto on how to hook up the Carambola 2 to the
Adafruit 128x128 and 128x96 colour display based on the SSD1351.

The Adafruit product page / tutorial:

The Carambola 2 evaluation board pinout:

http://www.8devices.com/wiki/carambola:2:specifications

To use the newer version with the Carambola 2 evaluation board:

* GND: PIN 21: (GND)
* VCC: PIN 22: (+5V)
* SDCS: (SD card chip enable; skip)
* OCS: PIN 30: (GPIO 19) (LCD chip enable)
* RST: PIN 29: (GPIO 20) (LCD reset)
* D/C: PIN 28: (GPIO 21) (Data/Command select)
* SCK: PIN 27: (GPIO 22) (SPI clock)
* MOSI: PIN 26: (GPIO 23) (SPI data write)
* MISO: (SPI data read; skip)
* CD: (SD card detect; skip)

The test program in src/beastie_ssd1351_128x128/ is configured to use
these GPIO pins on the Carambola 2 and the default Carambola 2
kernel in FreeBSD-HEAD should have these pins exposed.
Note it's for the 128x128 version; if you have the 128x96 version
then you should edit it and set 'height' to 96 in the cfg
definition.

To check if the GPIO pins are available, use 'gpioctl -l':

...
pin 18: 0       pin 18<IN>
pin 19: 1       pin 19<OUT>
pin 20: 1       pin 20<OUT>
pin 21: 0       pin 21<OUT>
pin 22: 1       pin 22<OUT>
pin 23: 0       pin 23<OUT>
...


As long as they show up as IN or OUT it'll work - the test
program will set the direction correctly.
